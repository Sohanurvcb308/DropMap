# DropMap
A Godot plugin that makes scene decoration as easy and convenient as possible for 3D use.

I'll hopefully flesh out this readme more later but I'm on my lunch break right now haha.

# How to install
1. Download the addons folder
2. Add it to the root of your Godot project, merge with existing addons folder if prompted
3. Go to your Project Settings > Plugins > DropMap and enable the plugin
4. Might need to restart Godot

# How to use
1. You should see a new node type available called "DropMap", add this to your scene.
2. Click the new DropMap node and the dock should appear
3. Create collections and add scenes to the collections via the dock.

# Additional Note
Please let me know if you experience any bugs and in what version of Godot you are using.
